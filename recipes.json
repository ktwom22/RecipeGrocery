The chocolate may hold its shape when you remove it from the microwave, but it will be soft, so stir to melt it. If pieces remain after you have stirred it for a while then return to microwave for another few seconds and then stir again until it is fully melted. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate. You are better off starting with less time and reheating than overheating and ruining it.- When chocolate has melted add the sugar and vanilla and stir with a whisk to combine. Let it cool a little and then add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition. Don't add the eggs when the chocolate is hot because it may cook the whites.- Once the eggs are mixed in, place the flour in a strainer and sift over the chocolate mixture, a little at a time, mixing it in as you sift it over. Set aside while you prepare the cream cheese layer.- For the cream cheese layer, place the cream cheese in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer for a couple of minutes until soft.- Add the sugar and mix to blend it in.- Add egg and beat to incorporate.- Add Bailey's and stir it in.- To assemble, spray an 8\" square baking pan with straight sides with non-stick spray, or butter and flour it. You can also line the baking pan with parchment, leaving the edges high so you can lift the entire cake out of the pan.- Pour the chocolate mixture into the pan and tilt it to spread it out evenly.- Pour the cream cheese mixture over it, and with a fork, swirl the layers so some of the chocolate shows on top and the cream cheese layer becomes part of the chocolate layer. Do not over mix - you just want some swirls.- Place in a preheated 350 degree F oven and bake for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean. Do not over bake.- Remove from oven and let cool before cutting into squares.",

        "instructions": "- Set two racks in the middle of the oven. Preheat to 375F.- In a food processor, or bowl of an electric mixer, thoroughly mix the flour, cocoa, baking soda and powder, salt, and sugar. While pulsing, or on low speed, add the butter, and then the egg. Continue processing or mixing until dough comes together in a mass.- Take rounded teaspoons of batter and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet approximately two inches apart. (I started off with loonie sized chunks of dough which was too big. Its more like the size of a quarter. Remember, youre aiming for 50 to 60 of these individual wafers!) With moistened hands, slightly flatten the dough. Bake for 9 minutes, rotating once for even baking. Set baking sheets on a rack to cool.- To make the cream, place butter and shortening in a mixing bowl, and at low speed, gradually beat in the sugar and vanilla. Turn the mixer on high and beat for 2 to 3 minutes until filling is light and fluffy.- To assemble the cookies, in a pastry bag with a 1/2 inch, round tip, pipe teaspoon-size blobs of cream into the center of one cookie. Place another cookie, equal in size to the first, on top of the cream. Lightly press, to work the filling evenly to the outsides of the cookie. (I dont think its entirely necessary to use a pastry bag. You could just spoon some icing on and squeeze between two wafers.) Continue this process until all the cookies have been sandwiched with cream.",

Stir to blend the butter and chocolate off the heat, and set aside.- Combine the eggs, espresso powder, and vanilla extract in a large bowl and cream together using an electric mixer. Add the brown sugar and mix until creamy.- In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and sea salt. Set aside.- Add the melted chocolate and butter to the egg mixture and blend together using an electric mixture. Then add the flour mixture and stir by hand just until the dry ingredients and are moist.- Add the chopped nuts and the chocolate chips to the chocolate and flour mixture folding them in gently. Note:  The dough will be relatively soft.- Drop by large tablespoonfuls onto the greased baking sheets at least 3 inches apart. If you want your cookies to look uniform in size then use a 2 oz. cookie or ice cream scoop.  Bake immediately to prevent the chocolate from hardening for 10 to 12 minutes. Rotate the pan halfway through the baking time. The cookies will still be very soft and sticky inside, but do not overcook the cookies or they will be crispy, rather than chewy. Cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets before gently removing the whoppers to a baking rack to cool completely.- Store the cookies in an airtight container separating the layers with wax paper.- Makes about 1 dozen 3-inch cookies",

If you want the gnocchi to look super nice, roll them on a fork to give them the characteristic stripes (I never do). Place the gnocchi in the fridge while you prepare the sauce.- Cut the savoy cabbage in stripes, wash it and stew it with a bit of water until wilted. Drain it and sautee it with 1 spoon butter and salt until cooked.- Prepare the cheese by dicing it and the rest of the butter by melting it with the sage and the garlic.- Cook the gnocchi in salted boiling water in batches. Throw 10-20 gnocchi in the pot of boiling water and fish them out once they start floating. Drain them and add them to a bowl. Dress with cheese, cabbage and butter and keep layering the ingredients in the bowl until you run out.- Do not mix the gnocchi in the bowl, as they are rather soft and would break.

        "instructions": "- Preheat an oven to 350- Stud the rinsed and peeled rack of corned beef ribs with the three cloves, fairly evenly spaced along the top meaty side of the ribs.- Place the ribs in a large, deep covered roasting pan or Dutch oven.- Sprinkle the peppercorns on top of the ribs along with the slices of garlic and the bay leaves.- Add enough water to just cover the ribs - this will vary depending on the size of your pan.- Put the pan, covered, into the oven and cook for one hour.- While the ribs are braising for the first hour, prepare the vegetables.- After the first hour, add all the vegetables, except for the cabbage, into the pan. Re-cover and return to the oven for 45 minutes.- After the 45 minutes, add the cabbage to the pan, re-cover and return to the oven for fifteen minutes.- During the final braising of the ribs and vegetables, prepare the glaze.- Combine the sugar, beer and vinegar in a small saucepan and heat to a boil over medium heat.- Cook at a low boil for 5 minutes, stirring often.- Remove the glaze from the heat, add the mustard and stir to combine.- Set aside until ribs and vegetables are finished braising.- Remove the vegetables and ribs from the oven when the cooking time is complete (about 2 hours).- Remove the ribs and place on a baking rack set over a pan. Re-cover the vegetables to keep them warm while you glaze the ribs.- Brush a light coat of glaze on the underside of the ribs and a thicker layer on the top side.  Use about 1/2 the glaze.- Place the ribs into the oven and cook for 15 minutes.  This will give you a good base layer of glaze.- After 15 minutes, remove the ribs for a final coating and turn the oven up to 425- Brush the rest of the glaze on the ribs, return to the oven and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the glaze is lightly browned and bubbly but not burned.- When the glazed ribs are done, allow to cook for a couple of minutes (that sugar will be hot!).- Remove the vegetables from the braising liquid and serve with the ribs on a platter to serve and cut at the table or cut the meat into rib sections. If you wish to forego the vegetables,  by the way, the ribs make a fantastic appetizer all on their own.",

Pulse until the butter is reduced to pea-sized pieces, with dough still dry. Transfer first half of the mix into a large bowl. Repeat process with the other half of the ingredients and add to the large bowl.- By hand: Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use a pastry cutter to incorporate the butter into the dough. Cut by pressing on butter, then gathering flour onto it in two quick strokes.  Cut until butter slices become pea-sized.- Dont over process or mix. Dough will be dry. Break large lumps of butter by hand, and toss dry dough with your fingers.- Blend the cheeses, dill, shallot and pepper with the Scone Mix using a wooden spoon. Drizzle the buttermilk over the dough and drop the cottage cheese in the middle, and stir until mixed. Add more buttermilk if dough is too dry to hold together.- Place dough on a lightly floured surface and divide into two. Form 2 discs and flatten each to a thickness of about 1-1/2 inches, cut into 6 wedges for a total of 12. Arrange an inch apart on a cookie sheet.- Bake for 15 minutes, rotate the pan, and bake another 10 to 15 minutes, until scones are light brown on top and darker at the bottom. Bread should no longer be soft and doughy in the center. Bake in 2 batches if scones dont fit in one cookie sheet.- Serve warm or cool in a wire rack before wrapping in foil or plastic wrap/bag. Freshly baked scones can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, and in the refrigerator for a week.",

        "instructions": "- Raspberry Sauce:- In a saucepan, add the frozen raspberries and powdered sugar.- Bring to a simmer and cook for about 3-4 minutes.- Gently mash the raspberries with the back of a spatula while they cook.- After 4 minutes, remove from heat and add the raspberry jam.  You could puree this mixture before serving, but I prefer it chunky.- Chocolate Sauce:- In a saucepan, add the chocolate chips and cream.- Allow the chocolate chips to melt, stirring occasionally.- Remove from heat once chips have melted and add the golden syrup.- Beignets:- Heat the 1% milk in a saucepan.- Once it starts to simmer, remove pan from heat and add the buttermilk.- Pour milk into a standing mixer.- To the milk, whisk in the yeast and sugar.  Let sit until foamy, approximately 5 minutes.- In a separate bowl, mix the flours, baking soda and salt.- Turn the mixer on low speed and slowly add the flour mixture until just incorporated and dough is in the shape of a ball and is slightly sticky.- Cover the standing mixer bowl with saran wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free location for about an hour.- After an hour, lightly flour your work surface and pour out your dough.- Using as little flour as possible, fold the dough over in half and tuck in the edges to make a ball.- Flatten the ball and with a floured rolling pin.- Roll the ball out into a circle until the circle is about  an inch thick.- Using a knife or other sharp object cut the dough into any shape you want.  I find that cutting the dough into long and thick logs makes the beignets good for dipping.- Let sit for a few minutes.- In the meantime, pour canola oil into a Dutch oven until the oil is about 2-3 inches deep.- Heat oil to 375 degrees.- Once oil is hot, drop in the dough  4-5 at a time and turn frequently.- Allow to fry for 2-3 minutes, or until a lovely golden dark brown.- Transfer the beignets to a drain on a paper towel lined plate.- Add some powdered sugar to the brown paper bag and drop in 3-4 beignets.- Close the bag and shake until the beignets are completely covered in powdered sugar.- Serve warm with the dipping sauces.",

Shred fish with your fingers.- Pour 3 inches of water into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the diced potatoes, and cook until tender, 10 to 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes, return them to the pan briefly. (The heat from the pan will evaporate excess moisture from the potatoes.) Mash the potatoes until smooth, then whisk in the butter.- Stir the cod into the mashed potatoes. Stir in the green onion, cilantro, olives, egg white, sesame oil, salt, garlic, ginger and pepper.- In a chilled bowl, whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Gently fold the whipped cream into cod mixture with a rubber spatula.- Using two large soupspoons, form about 3 tablespoons of the cod-potato mixture into an oval fish cake. Set the cod cake on a baking sheet and repeat with the remaining potato mixture.- Spread the breadcrumbs on a plate. Beat the egg in a wide, shallow bowl. Dip each cod cake into egg, turning it gently to coat all sides. Allow any excess egg to drip back into the bowl, then roll the cake in breadcrumbs to coat all sides. Set the coated fish cakes on a baking sheet.- Place a large skillet over medium heat and pour in 1/4 inch of vegetable oil. When the oil is hot - a corner of a cod cake will give off a lively sizzle when dipped in the oil - add as many of the fish cakes to the skillet as will fit without touching each other. (You may need to do this in two batches.) Cook, turning once, until golden brown, about 5 to 7 minutes.- Remove the fish cakes with a slotted spoon and drain them on paper towels.

Stir together, then let sit 10 minutes.\nAdd the Coach Oats mixture to yeast mixture and add the butter, salt, molasses, honey, wheat germ and milk to the bowl of an electric mixer and with the paddle attachment, mix together to combine.\nAdd the one cup of whole wheat flour and two cups of the all purpose flour. Mix until well combined. Clean off the paddle attachment, scrape the sides of the bowl and add the dough attachment to the mixer.\nWith the mixer going on low speed, add the remaining whole wheat flour a little at a time until the dough starts coming together.\nAfter two of the remaining cups are added, let the mixer knead the dough for a minute or so. If it is still sticking to the sides, add about 1/4 cup more flour, let it mix. Keep adding a little flour at a time until the ball of dough no longer sticks to the sides. Let it knead for 8-10 minutes on medium-low speed. Remove the bowl from the mixer.\nTake the dough out of the bowl and spray it with cooking spray. Return the ball of dough to the bowl, cover it with a towel or plastic wrap and let sit in a warm, dry place for an hour until doubled in size (mine took almost 2 hours).\nPunch down the dough and make 2.50 ounce sized balls of doughyoull get about 19 rolls.

Let them rise for about 45 minutes.\nDuring the last 20 minutes of rise time, preheat oven to 375 degrees.\nFill a dutch oven or oven safe pot with water and place on the lowest shelf of the oven, this will add steam in the oven.\nBrush each roll with egg wash. Bake the rolls for 17-23 minutes (you may have to do this in two batches, unless you have a huge oven). Let the rolls sit on the baking sheet sit for a few minutes, then remove rolls from pan and place on a wire rack to  cool completely.\nNOTE:  Due to the molasses, the rolls will have a brown tone, so when your baking them, make sure the bottom has a light brown color to them, at first I thought I was over cooking the rolls, and I wasnt, 19 minutes seemed to be perfect amount of time.\nServing Size: 19  2.5 oz rolls\nCalories per roll:  145,  Fat:  1.2,  Cholesterol:  .03,  Sodium:  20,  Potassium:  117,  Carbs:  29,  Fiber:  3,  Sugar:  3.8,  Protein:  4.9",

Add in the radish and cucumber slices, arugula and toss together.\nFor the scallops: heat oil in a high heat. Place the scallops flat-side down in the hot pan. Don't overcrowd the pan, or the pan won't stay hot enough to give the scallops a good sear. If you have a lot of scallops, it's better to work in batches.\nOnce you've placed the scallops in the pan, don't touch them. (Let them do their thing!) If you give in to the temptation to move the scallops around the pan, all you'll be doing is preventing them from forming the nice brown crust that you want. Because of variations in scallop thickness, pan temperatures and so on, it's not easy to pinpoint an exact cooking time. But after a couple of minutes, it's OK to peek underneath. If you see a nice, caramel-colored crust on the underside, they're ready to flip.\nPlate your salad and place 4 scallops on top. Scallops start to turn rubbery if you wait too long to serve them, so get them on the plate right away. And be sure to serve them with the beautiful caramel-colored crust facing up.",

        "instructions": "- Note: You can use a standing mixer with a dough hook to mix the dough, but we made our bread the old-fashioned way, kneading it with our hands.- Combine the yeast with warm water (this is referred to as proofing the yeast) in a small bowl along with the sugar. Gently stir the mixture to dissolve everything. Allow the yeast to stand for about 3 minutes until it gets a bit foamy.- Add the flour to a large bowl and make a well in the center of it.- In a small bowl, dissolve the salt in a few tablespoons of water, and add it to the flour along with the yeast mixture. Next add the olive oil to the mixture.- With your hands and a spatula to scrape down the bowl, mix everything together to form the dough. Punch down and knead the dough, turning it as you go, for at least 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, soft and pliable. Add a bit of flour to the dough as needed. Form the dough into a round ball.- Add some olive oil to your hands and smooth it over the dough ball to coat it and leave it in the bowl. Cover the bowl with a thick towel and place the bowl in a warm spot to let the dough rise to double its size (about 45 minutes to an hour).- Coat a baking sheet (with sides) with olive oil and sprinkle a few tablespoons of cornmeal over the entire pan. Set aside.- Once the dough has risen, place it on a floured surface and punch it down 3-4 times. Allow it to stand for a few minutes while you get your toppings ready.- Moving back to the dough, roll and stretch it out into an oblong shape that is about 1/2 an inch thick. Place the dough on the oiled baking sheet, cover it with plastic wrap and let it stand for about 15 minutes.- Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. After the dough has rested and youre ready to bake it, poke small wells all around the dough using your finger. Brush the surface of the dough with olive oil.- Evenly sprinkle on the dried oregano, green onion, tomato and garlic. Sprinkle with coarse salt, then grated Parmesan cheese.- Bake on the bottom rack for 20 minutes, checking it as it gets close to the end of the baking time.",

Add 1/4 of an avocado sliced, top with chopped fresh cilantro.- NOTES:- *1 The beans do not need to be soaked before adding to the slow cooker. They will be perfectly soft and creamy without pre-soaking.- *2 Substitute the water for: 2 cups water and 1 bottle of good quality dark beer like Negra Modelo. You can also substitute the water for chicken stock or pork stock. Each of these substitutions will add an extra dimension of flavor.- *3 If you want to shred the pork, it is easiest to do when the pork is hot. Use two forks to pull the pork apart and shred. If you want to slice the pork (like for sandwiches) it is best to do when the pork is cold. Let the pork rest in the refrigerator for several hours or over night.

Stir until the sugar has dissolved.- Add the chocolate  & espresso powder and stir until it is thoroughly melted. Remove from the heat, cover, and let cool for about 10 minutes or at least to room temperature.- Using a mixer, mix the butter on medium-high speed until it is smooth and creamy.- Turn the mixer to medium-low and add half of the chocolate mixture along with the vanilla. Mix well. Add the remaining chocolate mixture and mix until smooth and creamy. Set aside until it hardens slightly, to become a spreadable consistency, 1 to 2 hours. (Or, you can refrigerate the frosting for about 30 minutes, or until it becomes thickened and spreadable. Bring it to room temperature before frosting.)- To make the cake:- Preheat the oven to 350*- Generously grease three 9-inch round cake pans. Cut a piece of waxed paper to fit the bottom of each pan and place inside the pans. Grease the waxed paper, and dust the pans with cocoa powder until well coated. Set aside.- In a small heatproof bowl, pour the boiling water over the 1/2 cup cocoa. Stir until the mixture is very smooth, and set aside to cool.- Melt the chocolate in a double boiler. Stir occasionally until smooth. Remove from the heat.- Into a medium-size bowl, sift together both flours, the baking powder, and salt. Set aside.- In a bowl, beat the butter until smooth and creamy, (about 5 minutes). Add 2 1/4 cups of the sugar and beat until well blended, (about 5 minutes). Beat in the whole egg and egg yolks, one at a time. Beat in the cooled cocoa mixture until very smooth, scraping down the sides as you go. Turn the mixer to medium-low and add the melted chocolate, beating until well incorporated. Add the vanilla.- Turn the mixer to low and add half the dry ingredients. Then add the quark, mix well, and add the rest of the dry ingredients. Beat until smooth and creamy, 2 to 3 minutes.- In a bowl, using clean beaters, beat the egg whites at high speed. When frothy, add the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until the egg whites form stiff peaks, 5 to 6 minutes.- Using a large rubber spatula, fold about 1 cup of the chocolate mixture into the egg whites. Then gently fold that mixture back into the chocolate mixture, just until the egg whites are well incorporated. Do not overmix.- Distribute the batter evenly among the pans, and bake in the center of the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. Do not overbake.- Cakes are done when the tops are just beginning to crack and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs clinging to it. Let cool on a rack for about 15 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and let cool completely on a wire rack.- To assemble:- Place the first layer on a serving plate and frost the top only. Place the second layer on top of the first and frost the top. Repeat with the top layer. Spread the remaining frosting along the sides until the cake is completely covered with frosting.",

        "instructions": "- Begin by preheating the oven to 120C. An efficient oven is important for this dish. If the oven is too cold, the fish will not get cooked. If the oven tends to get too hot, the fish will be roasted and overcooked. If you are uncertain, then think about whether your cookies/cakes are usually overdone or underdone when you follow a recipe exactly. If they are always overdone, then you can turn down the temperature to 110C.- Get the freshest salmon fillets you can get your hands on. The thick ones are the nicest for this dish.- Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the salmon fillets and rub it all over the fish.- Season generously with salt and pepper. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I usually use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper for each time that I need salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the fish.- Slice two lemons into thick slices, discarding the ends. Lay the slices of lemons on a baking tray lined with baking paper.- Place the salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. If you have left the skin on for the fillets, then make sure its skin side down.- Place the salmon fillets in the oven and cook for 25 mins. If the salmon fillets are very thick, cook a little longer for another 3 to 5 mins.- While the fish is cooking, prepare the vegetable medley and sauce.- Peel a large carrot and diagonally slice into thin slices.- Wash and pluck the leaves of a bunch of spinach. I used about 150g of baby spinach.- Heat a deep saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Keep the heat at medium heat.- When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter.- When the butter has melted, add the carrots and stir fry for a minute to cook and soften the carrots. I like them slightly crunchy so I dont cook them for too long here. Keep the heat at medium.- Remove the cooked carrot slices and set aside in a warm place.- In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry for 20 seconds.- Add the spinach leaves. Stir fry at medium heat.- Add salt and pepper to taste. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I used Masterfoods Garlic Pepper seasonings instead again.- Stir fry the spinach till its soft and wilted. Careful not to overcook as they would lose their natural pretty green colour.- Dish up the cooked spinach and set aside in a warm place.- Now make the sauce.- Peel off the hard outer layer of 2 stalks of lemon grass. Slice into 2 inch long pieces and using the back of your knife, bash the lemongrass and bruise the slightly for the fragrance and flavours to emit.- Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan.- When the butter has melted and is bubbling slightly, add the lemongrass. Cook at medium heat for 30 seconds.- Add 150ml of fresh liquid cream. Let the mixture come to a gentle rolling boil.- Add 1 teaspoon of liquid chicken stock concentrate. Or you can use 1/2 cube of chicken stock bouillon. Stir it in well, and do a taste check. If its not salty enough, add more chicken stock.- Whisk the sauce as it boils and thickens.- After a couple of minutes, the sauce would have thickened. Remove the lemongrass.- Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I usually use a strainer and squeeze a lemon directly over the sauce. Do a taste check. Add more lemon juice if necessary. Whisk well to combine.- The salmon should be done by now. Remove them from the oven.- Plate your dish but placing some spinach and carrots at the bottom of a plate or shallow dish.- Gently place the salmon fillet on top. Drizzle a generous amount of sauce around the fish. Garnish with chives.",

Put lemon skins and remaining thyme underneath the chicken.- Roast for 10 minutes on 220C, then lower the heat to 180 C and cook for a further 25- 35 mins depending on how large the chicken is.- You can check if your chicken is ready by inserting a skewer/ fork into the thickest part ( thigh). If the juices run clear, your chicken is ready. If its still is pink, leave it in for a couple more minutes.- Take chicken out, keep warm and rest the chicken while you make the sauce.- Sauce on the side: Deglaze the roasting pan with a little white wine and chicken stock, bring to a simmer.

It's also easiest to mince the ginger by putting it through a garlic press. You can adjust the mix of ingredients to match your personal tastes.- Place the salmon in a deep bowl or ziploc bag and marinate in about half of the sauce, reserving the rest for serving. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour, more will break down the fish and cause it to \"cook\" a bit in the lime juice.- Grill skewers on a high heat and serve.

Mix and set aside to marinate for a bit.\nOnce the veggies are cooked, add the tofu- saute until slightly brown and soft enough that it crumbles. Add juice form half a lemon and half of the chopped cilantro. Mix and add the diced boiled potato, and toss until everything is coated, soft and taste for salt/spices. Using a masher, mash the mixture until mushy and until the veggies are small. Set aside to cool. Once cooled, add a bit of the breadcrumbs and mix with your hands. Start forming into thick patties (mixture should make 4). If its still giving you a hard time, add more breadcrumbs. Make 4 patties, place on a plate and wrap with plastic wrap until ready to use.\nIn a small skillet sprayed with PAM over medium-high heat, add one patty at a time. Cook for about 2 minutes on each side- until browned and crispy.At the same time, saute the thick slices of onion, until charred and slightly soft. Spread a generous amount of the chutney spread on each side on the bread, place burger, onions tomato and cilantro leaves. Serve with a slice of lemon and reduced-fat chips on the side.",

Get them dry and cool under cold water, then they stay nice and green.- The pepper may be under the grill until it sees black. Let them cool and peel them.- Chop the parsley.- Put the cooled broccoli in a long narrow bowl and blend finely with a hand blender. Add the oil and vinegar with the salt. Add half the parsley and mix into a smooth puree. If too grainy (dry) put some extra oil.- Cut the unseeded, peeled tomatoes and peppers into very small pieces.- The shallot or onion may be chopped in mini pieces.- Add the chopped vegetables to the puree and stir gently with a spoon. The rest of the chopped parsley may be added now. A little salt, soy sauce and chili powder. Start with a little bit and add some more later if desired. The herbs de Provence can now embellish the whole with its bright flavor.- The seaweed may now well out of the water and squeeze out any excess moisture. Cut the seaweed finely and mix carefully with the puree.- With an ice cream spoon you  create beautiful balls and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds.- bon apptit",

Mix and then knead them, using a mixer with a bread hook, or by hand, until you have a soft, smooth and elastic dough (about 8-10 minutes).- Put the dough in a oiled bowl and let it rise, covered, for 2 hours or until it's puffy and nearly doubled in size- Lightly grease/butter a 9inch round cake pan that's at least 2inch deep (or grease a 9inch or 10inch springform pan).- Toss the apple chunks with the sugar, cinnamon and rum.- Gently deflate the dough, transfer it to a lightly greased work surface, and flatte n it into a rough rectangle, about 8 x 10 inches.- Spread half the apple chunks in the center of the dough (see remarks for details).- Fold a short edge of the dough over the apple in order to cover it, patting firmly to seal the apples and spread the dough a bit.- Spread the remaining apple atop the folded-over dough.- Cover the apples with the other side of the dough, again patting firmly (Basically, you've folded the dough like a letter, enclosing the apples inside.).- Take a long knife and cut the apple-filled dough into 16 pieces. Cut in half, then each half in halves, etc ... (This will be very, VERY messy; the dough is slippery, apples will fall out, sugar syrup will ooze... it's not pretty. Don't worry, and don't stress about making all the pieces the same size).- Lay the dough chunks into the pan (Crowd them so that they all fit in a single tight layer - barely. Lots of apple chunks will fall out during this process; just tuck them in among the dough pieces, or simply spread them on top.).- Cover the challah gently with lightly greased plastic wrap or a damp towel and let it rise for about 1- 1 1/2 hours, until it's a generous 2inches high (It should just crest the rim of a 9inch round cake pan). Twenty minutes before the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 325 F.- Place the bread in the lower third of the oven. Bake it for 55 minutes, or until the top is at least light golden brown all over and has no white spots.- Remove the challah from the oven, and after 5 minutes loosen the edges and carefully transfer it to a rack.- Let cool completely. Then whisk together the cider and powdered sugar and brush it over the top--allowing it to drizzle down the sides.",

Lightly grease an 8-by-8-inch baking pan with cooking spray. To make removing the brownies easy, line the pan lengthwise and widthwise with two 7-by-12-inch sheets of parchment paper or aluminum foil, shiny side up, and use the overhang as handles.- Place the chocolate in a small heatproof bowl and set in a wide pan or skillet of hot water. Set aside for 5 minutes, stirring 4 to 5 times, and let it melt completely. Stir until smooth. In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt until well blended. Set aside.- With a stand or hand mixer set on low speed, beat the butter and sugar in a medium bowl until well blended. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, until fully blended, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl as necessary. Beat in the vanilla until blended. Alternately blend the dry ingredients and the melted chocolate into the egg mixture in increments. Using a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, fold in the walnuts. Stop when the ingredients are just blended. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking pan and spread evenly. Set aside.- Place large spoonfuls of the cheesecake mixture on top of the chocolate mixture and, using a butter knife, swirl to partially combine.- Place large spoonfuls of the cheesecake mixture on top of the chocolate mixture and, using a butter knife, swirl to partially combine.- Bake for 45-50 minutes or until set (do not over-bake).",

Reserve the eggs in a bowl of warm water.- Melt the butter in a saucepan or small frying pan over low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until tender but not coloured.- Prepare the bchamel sauce: melt the butter in a medium heavy-bottomed saucepan over low heat. Add the flour and whisk for about 2 minutes; do not allow it to colour. Whisk in the milk and bring to the boil, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Season with the nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10 minutes, whisking constantly and scraping the bottom and sides of the pan to prevent the sauce from sticking. Stir in the cooked onions and cook for 5 minutes.- Heat the grill. Slice the eggs 1 cm (0.4 inch) thick. Spread a thin layer of the bchamel sauce over the bottom of the gratin dish. Layer the egg slices over the bchamel sauce and coat with the remaining sauce. Sprinkle with grated cheese, then grill, turning the dish if necessary to colour evenly, until the top is golden brown.

Heat the mixture until steaming and it begins to foam.  Remove from the heat.\nIn a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks until pale yellow.  Gradually whisk in one cup of the warm cream mixture, whisking constantly.  Pour the yolks and cream mixture back into the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly being sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the pan.  Continue cooking until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a spoon.\nPlace some ice and water into a large bowl and place a smaller bowl inside. Pour the cream mixture through a mesh strainer into the bowl.  Stir in the pumpkin and vanilla, add the cinnamon stick back to the mixture. Chill thoroughly, preferably overnight.\nPour the mixture into the freezer can of an electric ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers instructions.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter untill soft.  Add the sugar and continue beating until smooth and creamy.  Stop the mixer occassionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the vanilla, molasses and egg, combine thoroughly.  Mix in the dry ingredients gradually until the dough is smooth.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in half. Roll each half until its about 2 inches around, like a log.  Wrap each log in plastic wrap and then roll them lightly to smooth them out.  Refrigerate or freeze until firm.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment.\nSlice the dough into 1/4 inch rounds with a serrated knift being careful to keep their shape. Place the rounds on the baking sheet and sprinkle with granulated or course sugar.\nBake for 10-13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time.  Let the cookies cool in the pan for about 2 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack.\nDough can be refrigertaed for up to five days or frozen for up to three months.  Baked cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for approximately a week.\nTo assemble the sandwiches:\n(Im sure this is a no-brainer, but.you never know.)\nThaw the ice cream until soft enough to scoop.  Because of the high water content from the pumpkin puree it tends to freeze very firmly.\nTake one scoop of ice cream and place on top of one gingersnap, using a second cookie place on top of the ice cream and gently press down.",

The chocolate may hold its shape when you remove it from the microwave, but it will be soft, so stir to melt it. If pieces remain after you have stirred it for a while then return to microwave for another few seconds and then stir again until it is fully melted. Be careful not to overheat the chocolate. You are better off starting with less time and reheating than overheating and ruining it.- When chocolate has melted add the sugar and vanilla and stir with a whisk to combine. Let it cool a little and then add the eggs, one at a time, whisking after each addition. Don't add the eggs when the chocolate is hot because it may cook the whites.- Once the eggs are mixed in, place the flour in a strainer and sift over the chocolate mixture, a little at a time, mixing it in as you sift it over. Set aside while you prepare the cream cheese layer.- For the cream cheese layer, place the cream cheese in a bowl and mix with a hand mixer for a couple of minutes until soft.- Add the sugar and mix to blend it in.- Add egg and beat to incorporate.- Add Bailey's and stir it in.- To assemble, spray an 8\" square baking pan with straight sides with non-stick spray, or butter and flour it. You can also line the baking pan with parchment, leaving the edges high so you can lift the entire cake out of the pan.- Pour the chocolate mixture into the pan and tilt it to spread it out evenly.- Pour the cream cheese mixture over it, and with a fork, swirl the layers so some of the chocolate shows on top and the cream cheese layer becomes part of the chocolate layer. Do not over mix - you just want some swirls.- Place in a preheated 350 degree F oven and bake for 35 minutes or until a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.

Once the eggs are thickened, take the bowl off the water and set aside.- Poach the eggs:- Fill a medium saucepan with water, add a splash of white vinegar (optional, but this helps hold the whites together which results in nicely shaped eggs) and bring to a gentle simmer. You want tiny bubbles only, not a rolling boil. Gently add eggs to water and poach until deisred doneness.- Meanwhile, toast bread.- Place toast on plates and top with arugula, spinach and salmon. Place eggs on top of salmon and spoon hollandaise over the top. Garnish with dill, salt and freshly cracked black pepper and serve.",

        "instructions": "- Preheat oven to 375 F.- For the pies:- Fill a medium saucepan (relatively the same size as the bowl) about 1/3 full with water and set over medium heat.- In a medium glass bowl, combine the bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate and shortening.- When the water simmers, place the bowl of chocolate and shortening over the simmering water and lower the heat. Make sure your bowl does not touch the simmering water. The more you stir the shinier your cookies will be.- When the chocolate and shortening has melted, remove the bowl from the heat; stir to assure it's completely mixed. Set aside to cool a few minutes.- Meanwhile, in another bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla paste, and espresso. Set aside.- In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside.- Whisk the melted chocolate into the sugar/egg mixture.- Add the flour mixture, whisk. Only whisk until blended, over-mixing can affect the texture of the pies.- Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, no need to grease the paper.- Drop a heaping tablespoon of batter (keeping the shapes as round as possible) onto the baking sheets. You are aiming for rounds that are about 2 inches in diameter. Take care to leave some room (about 2 inches) between each one to allow for spreading that will occur as they bake.- Bake for 6 to 8 minutes.- Leave in the oven an additional minute if they seem under baked. The cookie will have a brownie like crackling surface, and will feel soft, when ready.- Allow them to cool for about 10 minutes before gently lifting them off the baking sheet and onto a flat surface for piping the filling.- For the Filling:- Combine 1 1/4 cups sugar and the water in a small saucepan.- Heat over medium heat with a candy thermometer attached to the inside of the saucepan, and stir to dissolve. - When the mixture reaches 220 degrees F it is ready for the stand mixer.- Meanwhile, in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on medium speed until it begins to look very foamy(about 3 minutes).- Avoiding the whisk, gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons PLUS 1 teaspoon sugar. - Increase the speed to high and whip until soft white peaks are formed.- At this point check to see if your sugar has cooled. If it has cooled, turn heat back on to high until it comes back up to 220 degrees F just before adding to stand mixer.- When egg whites are at a soft peak stage resembling marshmallow fluff,slowly add the hot sugaralong the edge of the mixer avoiding the whisk.- Continue to whisk on high until the bowl has cooled, about 5 minutes.- Add peppermint extract, whisk another 30 seconds.- Refrigerate for 5 minutes before transferring to a piping bag with a plain tip attached or a large ziploc bag with one corner cut a 1/4 inch.- For Garnish:- Place candy canes between layers of wax paper, then sandwich between a dish towel.- Using a meat tenderizer, or the back of a dry measuring cup, pound the candy cane until broken up into very small pieces.- Make sure the candy cane is between wax paper first, otherwise, the candy cane will stick to the dish towel.- Assemble:- Turn the brookie cookies upside down, pipe about 2 tablespoons of filling onto half of the cookies.- Cover each filled cookie with a dry cookie, press down just enough so that filling adheres to the cookie.- Sprinkle crushed candy cane around the brookie pie edges.- Serve chilled or at room temperature.",

        "instructions": "- Have all the ingredients ready for assembly. In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat. Place 2 shrimp halves in a row across the center and top with basil, mint, cilantro and lettuce. Leave about 1 to 2 inches uncovered on each side.  Fold uncovered sides inward, then tightly roll the wrapper, beginning at the end with the lettuce.  Repeat with remaining wrappers and ingredients. Cut and serve at room temperature with dipping sauce.- The Culinary Chases Note: The rice wrapper can be fussy to handle if you let it soak too long. I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.  Enjoy!",

Make sure to press down the back of a spoon, and use damp hands to aid the process of putting it up the sides.- Chill for 20 minutes and then put to bake for 8-10 minutes. (Place it on top of a tray with baking paper since butter will leak a little)- Remove from the oven and let sit to room temperature.- Start making the toffee by placing melting the butter and brown sugar over medium-low heat till smooth.- Add in the sweetened condensed milk and bring to boiling point, before removing from heat. Make sure the mixture is thick and golden.- Add in the vanilla essence.- Let cool for 1/2 hour to 45 minutes, or till not hot to touch.- Lightly coat the bottom of the tart shell with a few spoonfuls of the toffee sauce,- Place a layer of bananas on top, making sure there are not banana pieces one on top of the other.- Pour a generous helping of the sauce on top, making sure to cover the bananas.- Depending on your tart shell's depth, add another layer of bananas on top, then another layer of sauce.- Place into the fridge to chill for 2-3 hours.- Meanwhile make the whipped cream by whipping the thickened cream with the vanilla essence and icing mixture till it holds its peak.- Meanwhile make the dark chocolate shards: Melt the chocolate in 20 second bursts in the microwave and pour onto a piece of baking paper. Spread using a flat spatula, leaving a thin coating of chocolate. Place in the fridge (if it is wonky, no worries) and remove from the fridge after an hour. Break into pieces to use.- Assemble the tart: Pipe little cornets all over the tart. Arrange pieces of chocolate shard on top artfully.",

        "instructions": "- Preheat the oven to 350F degrees, and position the oven racks in the upper and lower thirds positions. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.- In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter with the sugar on medium speed until light. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Continue to beat the mixture for 2 minutes more. Beat in the orange zest and vanilla extract.- In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just incorporated. On low speed, mix in the cranberries and the pecans.- Transfer the dough to a very lightly floured work surface, and divide it into 3 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a 12-inch log, spacing two of the logs apart on one of the prepared baking sheets and the third log on the second sheet.- Bake the logs for 15-18 minutes, until golden on top and lightly cracked. Transfer the positions of the baking sheets halfway through the baking process. Remove the sheets from the oven and allow to rest for 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 300F degrees.- Using a serrated knife, cut each log on the diagonal into 3/4-inch slices. Lay the slices on their sides and return the baking sheets to the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until lightly golden.- Prepare the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk together the confectioners sugar, and enough orange juice to make a pourable glaze. Drizzle the glaze over the warm biscotti, then allow the biscotti to rest until the glaze has set.- Makes 48 Cookies",

Pour the hot milk on to the egg and sugar mixture and stir.- Rinse out the milk pan dry and pour in the custard.- Heat stirring slowly and almost constantly until the mixture thickens.- There are a couple of things to bear in mind: if you make certain that the spoon gets right into the corners of the pan you run less risk of the custard curdling and on no account let the mixture boil otherwise the custard will scramble.- Pour the custard through a sieve into the little dishes filling them right to the top.- Set aside to cool then refrigerate overnight.- Dust the top of each custard with a thin layer of demerara then place under a very very hot grill for a few seconds until the sugar melts to a shiny caramel.- Leave to cool and harden.- Makes 8",

        "instructions": "Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.\nPeel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.\nRemove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\nNow it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.\nTightly roll the leaf into a bundle.\nRun your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.\nDon't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.\nIn a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.\nThen add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.\nWith a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\nNow it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\nCook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!",

        "instructions": "- Blanch the bacon to remove its smoky taste. Drop bacon slices into 2 quarts of cold water, bring to a boil, and simmer 6 to 8 minutes. Drain, rinse in cold water, and dry on paper towels.- In a large frying pan, saut the blanched bacon to brown slightly in a little oil; set them aside and add later to simmer with the beef, using the rendered fat in browning. Brown the chunks of beef on all sides in the bacon fat and olive oil, season with salt and pepper, and put them into a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or covered casserole pan. Cut the bacon into 1-inch pieces and add to the pan.- Remove all but a little fat from the frying pan, add the sliced vegetables and brown them, and add to the meat. Deglaze the pan with wine, pouring it into the casserole along with enough stock to almost cover the meat. Stir in the tomatoes and add the herb bouquet. Bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer slowly on the lowest heat possible, either on the stove or in a preheated 325F oven, until the meat is tender, about 1 to 2 hours.- While the stew is cooking, prepare the onions. Blanch the onions in boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and rinse in cold water to stop the cooking. Slice the end tips off of the onions, peel the onions and score the root end with 1/4 inch cuts. Saut onions in a single layer in a tablespoon or two of butter until lightly browned. Add chicken stock or water half way up the sides of the onions. Add a teaspoon of sugar, and season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer slowly for 25 minutes or until tender. The onions should absorb most of the water. If there is water remaining after cooking, drain the excess. Set aside.- Prepare the mushrooms a few minutes before serving the stew. Saut quartered mushrooms in a few tablespoons of butter and olive oil until browned and cooked through.- When the stew meat has cooked sufficiently, remove all solids from the sauce (except the beef) by draining through a colander set over a saucepan. Return the beef to the casserole. Press juices out of the residue into the cooking liquid, then remove any visible fat and boil down the liquid to 3 cups. Off heat, whisk in the beurre mani, then simmer for 2 minutes as the sauce thickens lightly. Correct seasoning and pour over the meat, folding in the onions and mushrooms. To serve, bring to a simmer, basting meat and vegetables with the sauce for several minutes until hot throughout.",

        "instructions": "Begin by pouring 4 C of whole milk into a large cooking pot. Add 1 C of sugar. Add 1 C of vegetable oil. Heat it over a medium flame and stir till sugar has dissolved. Do NOT boil.\nSet the mixture aside to cool till lukewarm. About 38 deg C. Check with your finger right into the mixture. If its hot, then cool some more. I should be just very mildly comfortably warm to the touch.\nWhen the mixture is lukewarm, add 2 packets of instant dry yeast (about 16g, 4.5 teaspoons). Sprinkle the yeast on the surface of the mixture. Leave it for 3 to 5 minutes. If the yeast is fresh and alive, you will see it growing and poofing up.\nAdd 8 C of plain flour. Mix it all up together. Dont overmix.\nCover with a table cloth and set aside covered in a warm place for 1 hour.\nAfter an hour, the dough would have risen to twice its size. Punch the dough down. Add the last C of flour.\nAdd 1 heaping teaspoon of baking powder.\nAdd 1 scant teaspoon of baking soda.\nAdd 2 teaspoons of salt.\nMix it up. Cover the dough again. And this time, either leave it in a warm place again for 1 hour. Or leave it covered in the fridge for 3 hours to rise slowly.\nNote: I left it in the fridge for 3 hours. The dough may be easier to manage when left to rise this way instead as it will be colder and harder.\nAfter the mentioned time, the dough would have risen again. Punch it down.\nKnead the dough for a few moments and then transfer the dough to the working table that has been lightly floured.\nIf the dough is too wet at this stage. Chill it in the fridge for a while. Itll help.\nFlour a rolling pin. And roll out the dough into a huge long rectangle.\nCut the dough into 2 parts. So that there are two long pieces of dough.\nPour 2 cups of melted butter onto the rolled out dough.\nNote: Check your dough. If its VERY wet, reduce the amount of melted butter added at this stage. When the rolls are laid out in the pan later, pour the rest of the melted butter on them instead. I really prefer to add all the melted butter at this stage because the flavour goes right into the dough.\nUsing fingers, evenly distribute the butter.\nSprinkle 1/4 cup of cinnamon over the dough.\nSprinkle 1 cup of castor sugar over the dough.\nSprinkle 1 cup of brown sugar over the dough. As brown sugar gets clumpy. I scattered the sugar on the dough with my fingers.\nChop some pecan nuts to get about 2 cups worth of chopped pecans.\nSprinkle the chopped pecan nuts onto the rolled dough.\nRoll up the dough, lengthwise. It will be a really long roll. If the dough is very wet and you are struggling to roll it, add some flour to the surfaces to help you roll.\nCut into 1 inch thick rolls.\nRub pans or baking dishes generously with more melted butter. Place the cinnamon rolls comfortably in each pan/dish. Do not overcrowd as they will expand alot in the pan. Pour remaining butter over the rolls. Dont be afraid!\nSet them aside for 1 hour. If theres wind/draft in your kitchen, cover the rolls with table cloths. The rolls will rise some more.\nPop the rolls into a oven, preheated at 180 deg Celsius. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes.\nWhile the rolls are baking, make the icing. Dont get stressed about the proportions. Just mix the ingredients till you get a gooey consistency to pour over like syrup.\nMake a 1/4 cup of strong coffee with 1/4 cup water and one 3-in-1 coffee mix.\nAdd 1 tablespoon of the best honey you can get your hands on. Maple syrup works too.\nStir the honey into the coffee.\nAdd a pinch of salt.\nAdd 6 tablespoons of melted butter.\nAdd 2 cups of icing sugar.\nWhisk it all up.\nAdd 1 to 2 tablespoons of fresh cream.\nStir in the cream.\nPour the icing over the rolls while they are still hot.",

        "instructions": "- Preheat oven to 350F.- Grease and flour a 9-inch spring form pan or a 9-inch cake pan with 3-inch sides (recommended by Williams Sonoma). I used an Angel Food Cake Pan.- For the streusel:- Combine the flours, brown sugar, cinnamon and kosher salt in a small bowl.- Add Earth Balance Soy Free Spread into the dry ingredients.- Work the spread into the mixture with your hands until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs.- Add the pecans, combine. Set aside.- For the batter:- Measure your coconut milk and add the apple cider vinegar to it.- Let it sit without mixing to become sour-creamy looking. Set aside.- In a medium bowl, sift together, or whisk the flours, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and kosher salt.- In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat together the butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until well combined.- Add the mashed banana, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula when needed.- Add the pumpkin puree and sour cream mixture and continue to mix on low speed.- Add in the flour mixture.- The batter will be quite thick which is how it should be.- Note: If your batter is not thick for some reason add 1/4 cup of white rice flour.- Spread half of the thick batter into the prepared pan.- Sprinkle half of the streusel over the batter.- Add the remaining batter over the streusel and spread the thick batter evenly.- Evenly spread the remaining streusel over the batter.- Bake 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.- Transfer the cake in the pan to your stovetop and let it cool for about 40 minutes.- When cooled, remove the sides of the cake from the pan using a spreader type knife, or something that will not scratch your cake pan.- Gently lift up the cake by pressing the removable bottom upwards.- I then refrigerated the cake with the bottom part still holding the cake for about an hour.- Transfer the chilled cake to a cake platter.- Put pieces of wax or parchment paper under the edges of the cake to keep the glaze drips from making a mess of your platter.- For the glaze:- In a glass bowl set over a small saucepan with simmering water, combine mini chips with Earth Balance spread.- Mix often to get a glossy sheen.- When completely melted take off the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes before glazing the cake.- Using a large spoon drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the cake.- Slowly pull out the papers along the cake.- Serve chilled, or room temperature.",

Not only are you further flavouring the chicken, but the chicken skin will be crispier when roasted.- Put chicken on to a roasting pan, pour lemon juice around it. Put lemon skins and remaining thyme underneath the chicken.- Roast for 10 minutes on 220C, then lower the heat to 180 C and cook for a further 25- 35 mins depending on how large the chicken is.- You can check if your chicken is ready by inserting a skewer/ fork into the thickest part ( thigh). If the juices run clear, your chicken is ready. If its still is pink, leave it in for a couple more minutes.- Take chicken out, keep warm and rest the chicken while you make the sauce.- Sauce on the side: Deglaze the roasting pan with a little white wine and chicken stock, bring to a simmer. Add a cornflour mixture (water and cornflour) till you are happy with the consistency of the sauce. Season to tasteYUM, its all the lemony, buttery, garlicky thyme goodness",

        "instructions": "- Pears:- Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Peel, core and quarter the pears. Melt the butter in a large casserole or baking dish (I used a 10 quart Le Creuset Dutch Oven), add the pears and cook over high heat for about ten minutes or until the pears are golden brown. Keep stirring them so they are evenly colored. Transfer the baking dish/casserole into the oven for 7-10 minutes until the pears are easily pierced with a paring knife. Remove the pears from the oven, transfer to a bowl, and let them cool to room temperature.- Blackberry Sauce:- Wash and dry the blackberries. (I use a salad spinner).  Reserve  cup of the berries for garnish. Put the 3 cups of blackberries, the powered sugar and the lemon juice in a food processor and pure. Pour the pure into a bowl and set aside.- Pre-heat oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit. Take a full size sheet pan and line it with a silpat mat. (If you dont have one, use parchment paper sprayed with Pam cooking spray) Get a large pastry bag with a star tip ready. Put the granulated sugar in a food processor and blitz into a very fine powder, about a minute. Transfer the superfine sugar to a bowl. Add the confectioners sugar and the chocolate to the food processor and process until the chocolate is pulverized into tiny flecks. Transfer to a bowl. Pour the egg whites into a mixing bowl and beat at slow speed with a whisk attachment until the egg whites begin to froth, then add the cream of tartar. Increase the speed to high and beat the whites until they form stiff peaks. Add the superfine sugar and continue to beat for another two minute- Using a spatula, fill the pastry bag with the egg white mixture and pipe out the meringue kisses onto the lined baking sheet. As you finish squeezing out a dollop of egg white, gently push the star tip of the pastry bag into the dollop about  inch and then quickly pull it away: that action gives the top a small point.- When all the meringues are piped out, place the baking sheet in the oven for an hour-and-a half. Youre not baking the meringues, but simply drying out the egg whites. Theyre done when the meringue is hard to the touch. Remove the meringues from the oven and let cool to room temperature.- To plate and serve, spoon several tablespoons of blackberry sauce into the center of a bowl, add 3 0r 4 pear quarters, several meringue kisses, and garnish with a few whole blackberries.",

You could puree this mixture before serving, but I prefer it chunky.- Chocolate Sauce:- In a saucepan, add the chocolate chips and cream.- Allow the chocolate chips to melt, stirring occasionally.- Remove from heat once chips have melted and add the golden syrup.- Beignets:- Heat the 1% milk in a saucepan.- Once it starts to simmer, remove pan from heat and add the buttermilk.- Pour milk into a standing mixer.- To the milk, whisk in the yeast and sugar.  Let sit until foamy, approximately 5 minutes.- In a separate bowl, mix the flours, baking soda and salt.- Turn the mixer on low speed and slowly add the flour mixture until just incorporated and dough is in the shape of a ball and is slightly sticky.- Cover the standing mixer bowl with saran wrap and let sit in a warm, draft-free location for about an hour.- After an hour, lightly flour your work surface and pour out your dough.- Using as little flour as possible, fold the dough over in half and tuck in the edges to make a ball.- Flatten the ball and with a floured rolling pin.- Roll the ball out into a circle until the circle is about  an inch thick.- Using a knife or other sharp object cut the dough into any shape you want.  I find that cutting the dough into long and thick logs makes the beignets good for dipping.- Let sit for a few minutes.- In the meantime, pour canola oil into a Dutch oven until the oil is about 2-3 inches deep.- Heat oil to 375 degrees.- Once oil is hot, drop in the dough  4-5 at a time and turn frequently.- Allow to fry for 2-3 minutes, or until a lovely golden dark brown.- Transfer the beignets to a drain on a paper towel lined plate.- Add some powdered sugar to the brown paper bag and drop in 3-4 beignets.- Close the bag and shake until the beignets are completely covered in powdered sugar.- Serve warm with the dipping sauces.",

        "instructions": "- Add the flour, cornmeal, powdered sugar, and salt to the food processor. Pulse a couple times. Then cut the shortening in to cubes and pulse it into the dry mixture.- Add 3 Tb. of ice water and pulse until the dough comes together. Add a little more water if needed.- Dump the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and divide it into a large and small piece--80/20. Shape the dough into two disks, then wrap both pieces and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.- Peel and dice the apples. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.- In a small sauce pan, add the butter and remaining six ingredients over medium heat. Stir and bring to a simmer. Pour the syrup over the apple and toss.- Take the larger disk of dough out of the fridge. Roll it out on a well-floured work surface to approximately 1/8 inch thick. Using a drinking glass with a 3  -4 inch wide rim, cut out dough circles. Press the dough circles into muffin tinsif you gather the extra pieces and re-roll, you should be able to get 14-16.- Fill each crust with an equal portion of apple mixture.- Roll out the smaller piece of dough. Using a 2-3 inch decorative cookie cutter, cut out tops for each pie. Place each top on the pies and Brush them with the remaining syrup from the apple bowl.- Bake the mini pies for 15 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F, and bake another 15 minutes. If the tops are golden after the first 15 minutes, lay a sheet of foil over them.- Allow the pies to cool completely before trying to remove them from the muffin tins.- NOTES~ Silicone muffin pans make it extremely easy to extract the pies. If using metal muffin tins, run a small sharp knife around ONE rim at a time, and gently dump one pie out into your hand, before moving on to the next.- If you would like to make this as a whole 9 inch pie, make the crust as directed and split the dough into equal pieces. Then DOUBLE the amount of apples and syrup mixture. Bake the pie for 30 minutes at 425, then 30 minutes at 350!",

Set aside.- For the batter:- Measure your coconut milk and add the apple cider vinegar to it.- Let it sit without mixing to become sour-creamy looking. Set aside.- In a medium bowl, sift together, or whisk the flours, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and kosher salt.- In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the flat beater, beat together the butter and brown sugar on medium-high speed until well combined.- Add the mashed banana, scraping down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula when needed.- Add the pumpkin puree and sour cream mixture and continue to mix on low speed.- Add in the flour mixture.- The batter will be quite thick which is how it should be.- Note: If your batter is not thick for some reason add 1/4 cup of white rice flour.- Spread half of the thick batter into the prepared pan.- Sprinkle half of the streusel over the batter.- Add the remaining batter over the streusel and spread the thick batter evenly.- Evenly spread the remaining streusel over the batter.- Bake 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.- Transfer the cake in the pan to your stovetop and let it cool for about 40 minutes.- When cooled, remove the sides of the cake from the pan using a spreader type knife, or something that will not scratch your cake pan.- Gently lift up the cake by pressing the removable bottom upwards.- I then refrigerated the cake with the bottom part still holding the cake for about an hour.- Transfer the chilled cake to a cake platter.- Put pieces of wax or parchment paper under the edges of the cake to keep the glaze drips from making a mess of your platter.- For the glaze:- In a glass bowl set over a small saucepan with simmering water, combine mini chips with Earth Balance spread.- Mix often to get a glossy sheen.- When completely melted take off the saucepan and let it cool for 5 minutes before glazing the cake.- Using a large spoon drizzle melted chocolate over the top of the cake.- Slowly pull out the papers along the cake.- Serve chilled, or room temperature.",

Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar.  Reduce to heat to low and simmer for 10 min so the flavors of the herbs can be drawn out. Pour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water.  Set aside.- Clean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface.  Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients, because no one is a fan of salmonella!  Place the chicken in the brine,  make sure it is completely immersed in the brine.  Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour and up to 6 hours.- Preheat the oven to 375F.- Remove the chicken from the brine and place on a clean surface.  Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel as shown.  Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket.  Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh  this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat.  Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.- Bake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes.  To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F.  If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked.  Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.- Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes.  This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board.  To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints.  Remove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way.  To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage.  Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints.  You can choose to serve the breasts whole or cut them into thin slices.",

When it reaches a medium high heat, add the shallots and garlic and saut for a minute.\nAdd the sprouts, cook until they are browned and become a little softer ( not too soft though, you dont want them to be mushy, but to retain a little bite).  You can probably get going with cooking the pasta when the sprouts are nearly finished.  Just follow the instructions on the packet for timings.  The best way to cook pasta is to put it into a pan with plenty of boiling water and a good helping of salt.\nWhen the sprouts are cooked, move them to the outside area of the pan and add the bacon to the centre, allowing it to cook for a couple of minutes, turning a couple of times.\nWhen the bacon is cooked, mix it through the sprouts and give a good grind of black pepper and a little salt.  Careful with salt as the bacon and the parmesan will also add a salty flavour.\nWhen the pasta is ready, bring your two pans close together on the stove.  Then, with tongs, grab the pasta and drag is swiftly into the pan with the sprouts.  By doing this you take in some of the pasta water.  This water helps bind and create your sauce.  You dont need  much, in this case probably about 2 tablespoons worth.  This dragging technique should ensure that you have enough.\nTurn the heat off under your sprouts and pasta.  Add the egg (not directly on to the base of the pan but onto the pasta mixture) add the parmesan.  Stir through quite quickly, this will create a creamy style sauce.\nCheck for seasoning, and serve immediately with some extra parmesan sprinkled over the top if you wish.\nThis works well with all sorts of pasta.  The only type that doesnt work so well for a carbonara style dish is whole meal or gluten free varieties.  These pastas seem to lack the starchy constituent that gives your sauce that creamy texture.\nTry using pecorino cheese instead of parmesan",

Place the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender.\nWhile the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside.\nClean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.\nAs the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.\nWhile the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside.\nWhen the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.\nDrizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing.\nSlice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink.\nServe by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets.\nI like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese.\nGarnish with the orange zest.\nTrickle the vinaigrette over the salad.\nBest served immediately.",

The pork can be either shredded for cubed for your preference. *3- Serving Suggestion: Scoop about 1 cup of beans with broth into a soup bowl. Top with shredded pork. Add 1/4 of an avocado sliced, top with chopped fresh cilantro.- NOTES:- *1 The beans do not need to be soaked before adding to the slow cooker. They will be perfectly soft and creamy without pre-soaking.- *2 Substitute the water for: 2 cups water and 1 bottle of good quality dark beer like Negra Modelo. You can also substitute the water for chicken stock or pork stock. Each of these substitutions will add an extra dimension of flavor.- *3 If you want to shred the pork, it is easiest to do when the pork is hot. Use two forks to pull the pork apart and shred. If you want to slice the pork (like for sandwiches) it is best to do when the pork is cold. Let the pork rest in the refrigerator for several hours or over night.

I think he likes it.\nIn a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the sugar.\nAdd the melted butter, and mix well.\nPress the graham cracker mixture into a pie plate, and refrigerate for about a half hour.\nNow, the filling! Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.\nStir in the brown sugar (and molasses, if you're using it). Keep the heat low, and stir until the brown sugar is all melted and bubbly.\nAdd 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, and stir until the brown sugar and butter are dissolved.\nStir in the remaining 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, all of the milk, and the salt.\nRemove from heat, and let cool until lukewarm. I find this only takes about 10 minutes.\nMix together the cornstarch and water, and pour it into the pudding mixture.\nReheat over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture starts to thicken. It'll thicken fast with all that corn starch!\nTurn heat to low, and continue to stir vigorously while keeping it at a good simmer for about a minute.\nRemove from heat, and stir in the whiskey and vanilla. Whiskey wasn't in my original Butterscotch Pudding recipe, but I love the addition for this pie. Gives it a little extra somethin' somethin'.\nPour the pudding mixture into the chilled pie crust.\nCover with plastic wrap and chill for at least two hours.\nReady for the topping? Whip the 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream with the wire whisk attachment on your stand mixer (you can do this by hand, but it would be quite the workout).\nAdd the sugar and vanilla to the cream while it's whipping. It's ready when soft peaks form. Yum.\nI'm stating the obvious, but remove the pie from the fridge and take off the plastic wrap.\nPile on the whipping cream. I like to spread it almost to the edges, but not quite - gotta give folks a glimpse of the actual pie yumminess!\nIf you want, garnish with a little shaved chocolate. I just took the carrot peeler to a Hershey bar.\nOr leave it plain. Either way!\nEnjoy!",

Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the edges begin to show some color.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.- While the peppers are roasting, prepare your stuffing.  Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined.  Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.- Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet.  There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).- Put on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.",

        "instructions": "- Preheat oven to 375 F.- For the pies:- Fill a medium saucepan (relatively the same size as the bowl) about 1/3 full with water and set over medium heat.- In a medium glass bowl, combine the bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate and shortening.- When the water simmers, place the bowl of chocolate and shortening over the simmering water and lower the heat. Make sure your bowl does not touch the simmering water. The more you stir the shinier your cookies will be.- When the chocolate and shortening has melted, remove the bowl from the heat; stir to assure it's completely mixed. Set aside to cool a few minutes.- Meanwhile, in another bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla paste, and espresso. Set aside.- In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside.- Whisk the melted chocolate into the sugar/egg mixture.- Add the flour mixture, whisk. Only whisk until blended, over-mixing can affect the texture of the pies.- Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, no need to grease the paper.- Drop a heaping tablespoon of batter (keeping the shapes as round as possible) onto the baking sheets. You are aiming for rounds that are about 2 inches in diameter. Take care to leave some room (about 2 inches) between each one to allow for spreading that will occur as they bake.- Bake for 6 to 8 minutes.- Leave in the oven an additional minute if they seem under baked. The cookie will have a brownie like crackling surface, and will feel soft, when ready.- Allow them to cool for about 10 minutes before gently lifting them off the baking sheet and onto a flat surface for piping the filling.- For the Filling:- Combine 1 1/4 cups sugar and the water in a small saucepan.- Heat over medium heat with a candy thermometer attached to the inside of the saucepan, and stir to dissolve. - When the mixture reaches 220 degrees F it is ready for the stand mixer.- Meanwhile, in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on medium speed until it begins to look very foamy(about 3 minutes).- Avoiding the whisk, gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons PLUS 1 teaspoon sugar. - Increase the speed to high and whip until soft white peaks are formed.- At this point check to see if your sugar has cooled. If it has cooled, turn heat back on to high until it comes back up to 220 degrees F just before adding to stand mixer.- When egg whites are at a soft peak stage resembling marshmallow fluff,slowly add the hot sugaralong the edge of the mixer avoiding the whisk.- Continue to whisk on high until the bowl has cooled, about 5 minutes.- Add peppermint extract, whisk another 30 seconds.- Refrigerate for 5 minutes before transferring to a piping bag with a plain tip attached or a large ziploc bag with one corner cut a 1/4 inch.- For Garnish:- Place candy canes between layers of wax paper, then sandwich between a dish towel.- Using a meat tenderizer, or the back of a dry measuring cup, pound the candy cane until broken up into very small pieces.- Make sure the candy cane is between wax paper first, otherwise, the candy cane will stick to the dish towel.- Assemble:- Turn the brookie cookies upside down, pipe about 2 tablespoons of filling onto half of the cookies.- Cover each filled cookie with a dry cookie, press down just enough so that filling adheres to the cookie.- Sprinkle crushed candy cane around the brookie pie edges.- Serve chilled or at room temperature.",

Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.\nIn the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.\nPlace a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).\nPour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.\nCook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.\nI usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.\nTo keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.\nSo, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.\nWhen you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.",

Depending on the size and shape of your bowl you may need a little bit more buttermilk in order that the chicken is covered. Cover with some cling film and place in the fridge for up to 8 hours. Remove before frying to give enough time to bring the meat up to room temperature.\n2.In a dish or bowl combine the flour, half teaspoon of salt, smoked paprika, thyme and pepper. Combine with your fingers or a fork.\n3.Remove the chicken from the buttermilk marinade and dispose of the marinade. Shake off most of the drips and then dredge the chicken in your flour mix making sure each piece is covered completely.\n4.Heat about 1.5cm / 0.5 in. of oil in a heavy bottomed wide pan. While this is heating up you can get a wire rack ready to drain the chicken. I do this by placing kitchen paper over the rack.\n5.The oil temperature should be about 170C / 340F for frying. I dont check with a thermometer but by putting a piece of bread in the oil and it is ready when it fizzes and turns brown quickly. The time the oil takes to heat up will depend on the thickness of the metal of your pan, your stove top and the quantity of oil you have used.\n6.You will probably have to cook in batches so as not to over load the pan. I start with the thighs which need a little bit more time than the legs. Place each one carefully in the pan and fry, covered, on a good strong simmer for anywhere between 8 to 12 minutes on each side. The heat needs to be high enough to give you a nice brown colour and a crisp finish. Remove and set on the rack to drain. Then do the same with the legs, giving them a couple of minutes less than the thighs.",

I think he likes it.\nIn a medium bowl, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the sugar.\nAdd the melted butter, and mix well.\nPress the graham cracker mixture into a pie plate, and refrigerate for about a half hour.\nNow, the filling! Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.\nStir in the brown sugar (and molasses, if you're using it). Keep the heat low, and stir until the brown sugar is all melted and bubbly.\nAdd 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, and stir until the brown sugar and butter are dissolved.\nStir in the remaining 1/2 cup of the heavy cream, all of the milk, and the salt.\nRemove from heat, and let cool until lukewarm. I find this only takes about 10 minutes.\nMix together the cornstarch and water, and pour it into the pudding mixture.\nReheat over medium high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture starts to thicken. It'll thicken fast with all that corn starch!\nTurn heat to low, and continue to stir vigorously while keeping it at a good simmer for about a minute.\nRemove from heat, and stir in the whiskey and vanilla. Whiskey wasn't in my original Butterscotch Pudding recipe, but I love the addition for this pie. Gives it a little extra somethin' somethin'.\nPour the pudding mixture into the chilled pie crust.\nCover with plastic wrap and chill for at least two hours.\nReady for the topping? Whip the 1 1/2 cups chilled heavy whipping cream with the wire whisk attachment on your stand mixer (you can do this by hand, but it would be quite the workout).\nAdd the sugar and vanilla to the cream while it's whipping. It's ready when soft peaks form. Yum.\nI'm stating the obvious, but remove the pie from the fridge and take off the plastic wrap.\nPile on the whipping cream. I like to spread it almost to the edges, but not quite - gotta give folks a glimpse of the actual pie yumminess!\nIf you want, garnish with a little shaved chocolate. I just took the carrot peeler to a Hershey bar.\nOr leave it plain. Either way!\nEnjoy!",

When the vegetables are done sprinkle with a little balsamic vinegar.\nWhen the couscous are done stir in the extra-virgin olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes, and pesto to make the couscous moist and fragrant. Add the balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper.\nAdd the roasted vegetables to the couscous and mix with the couscous. Add the feta cheese and mix with the roasted vegetables and couscous.

        "instructions": "- Pulse the almond flour and powdered sugar until blended, then sift twice to make sure all larger pieces of almond are separated out and the flour is blended well.- Add the lemon zest and lavender to the flour and set aside.- Pulse the white sugar in processor until very fine.- In the large bowl of a standing mixer or by hand, start whipping egg whites until foamy.- Add a pinch of cream of tartar, and whip until soft peaks form.- Reduce speed to low, and add the fine white sugar one tablespoon at a time.  When fully incorporated, increase speed to medium and then to high, and whip until stiff-peaked.  Timing varies on this, and this is where practice makes perfect.  Add your food coloring gel when almost completely done whipping.- Sift 1/3 of the flour into the egg and fold in completely.  Repeat until all the flour is incorporated.  You want to fold in until the batter is smooth, but still light.- Spoon into pastry bag fitted with a large tip (I use between 1/2 and 1 inch, depending on what I grab first).  Pipe 1 inch rounds onto parchment lined baking sheets, pulling the tip to the side so as to not leave a peak mark.  I use very thick sheets for this recipe.  Double up if needed.- Tap the pan somewhat assertively on the counter to remove any trapped air and help batter to settle.- Let sit for 1/2  2 hours, until a shell forms on the top and your finger pressed lightly doesnt leave a mark.- Now, bakers are completely split on the right temperature for baking macarons.  Some bake slowly at 270-350 degrees.  I tried to keep my temperamental oven at around 300 for these, holding the door slightly ajar with a spoon.  This way I can keep them in longer to assure that the insides are cooked without browning them on top, which happened with a batch that was drier / baked higher.- Bake in fully preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn the pan, and bake for around 8 minutes more, or until the feet of the macaron are a bit sturdier than soft.- Cool on sheets for two minutes, then remove to rack to cool completely.- Fill with prepared lemon curd and refrigerate to harden. - Serve at room temperature with tea.  Preferably wearing a skirt.  Or at least barefoot.",

Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.\nSpiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.\nTo assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.\nEnjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein!

Pulse until the mushrooms are finely minced and all of the ingredients are well combined. It will help if youve given the mushrooms a bit of a rough chop first, or if you use pre-sliced mushrooms.\nPlace a won ton wrapper on your work surface, turned so that it appears to be a diamond shape.\nPlace a teaspoon of filling in the middle of the wrapper.\nDip a fingertip into the bowl of water and trace along the two edges farthest from you. Bring up the end closest to you, fold over the filling, and pinch the edges together to seal. Make sure youve gently pressed the wrapper around the filling so there are no air pockets.\nStand up your little triangle pocket so that the filling side sits on your work surface. Fold the top point down, away from you, and pinch. Now, give the edges on either side of that fold 2 little pleats and pinch. Your pot sticker will now look like it has wings. Place it on a large plate thats been dusted with a bit of cornstarch, to prevent sticking.  (Traditionally, pot stickers are made with round dumpling wrappers, so if you have them, you can skip the part about folding the top point down.)\nHeat the skillet over medium-high heat. Brush just a few drops of oil onto the hot pan surface, and place 12 of the pot stickers, upright, into the pan. Allow the bottoms to brown. Carefully add 1/2 cup water to the pan and cover it quickly. Cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed. Remove the pot stickers immediately to another plate to keep warm, and repeat the procedure with the rest of the uncooked ones.\n*Feel like you have to have meat? Substitute 4 oz. of ground chicken (or pork, if you must) for half of the mushrooms, just dont run it through the food processor. Mix the processed ingredients with the ground chicken thoroughly and fill the wrappers as before. Add a full cup of water (instead of 1/2 cup) to the pan, and steam until the water evaporates, about 5-6 minutes.",

Then cut the shortening in to cubes and pulse it into the dry mixture.- Add 3 Tb. of ice water and pulse until the dough comes together. Add a little more water if needed.- Dump the dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap and divide it into a large and small piece--80/20. Shape the dough into two disks, then wrap both pieces and place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.- Peel and dice the apples. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.- In a small sauce pan, add the butter and remaining six ingredients over medium heat. Stir and bring to a simmer. Pour the syrup over the apple and toss.- Take the larger disk of dough out of the fridge. Roll it out on a well-floured work surface to approximately 1/8 inch thick. Using a drinking glass with a 3  -4 inch wide rim, cut out dough circles. Press the dough circles into muffin tinsif you gather the extra pieces and re-roll, you should be able to get 14-16.- Fill each crust with an equal portion of apple mixture.- Roll out the smaller piece of dough. Using a 2-3 inch decorative cookie cutter, cut out tops for each pie. Place each top on the pies and Brush them with the remaining syrup from the apple bowl.- Bake the mini pies for 15 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 degrees F, and bake another 15 minutes. If the tops are golden after the first 15 minutes, lay a sheet of foil over them.- Allow the pies to cool completely before trying to remove them from the muffin tins.- NOTES~ Silicone muffin pans make it extremely easy to extract the pies. If using metal muffin tins, run a small sharp knife around ONE rim at a time, and gently dump one pie out into your hand, before moving on to the next.- If you would like to make this as a whole 9 inch pie, make the crust as directed and split the dough into equal pieces. Then DOUBLE the amount of apples and syrup mixture. Bake the pie for 30 minutes at 425, then 30 minutes at 350!",

Cool the strawberries completely before using.  These can be made ahead of time and kept in the fridge.- For the ice cream base: Add the coconut milk, 1/2 cup of raw cane sugar, and the cardamom to a sauce pan.  Using a small knife, cut down the length of the vanilla bean and scrape all of the seeds into the coconut milk mixture.  Add in the vanilla bean as well.  Heat the mixture over medium, whisking to incorporate the sugar.  Bring the mixture to a boil, then remove it from the heat.  Stir in the xanthan gum or vodka if using.  Cover the mixture and allow it to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight. **If you are making popsicles instead of ice cream, add the roasted strawberries to your ice cream base, remove the vanilla bean halve, then pour it into your popsicle molds and freeze at least 4 hours.  If using wooden sticks, freeze the popsicles one hour before inserting them.  **- For the ice cream: Remove the vanilla bean halve from the ice cream base and discard it.  Process the mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions on your ice cream maker.  I added in the strawberries after about 10 minutes when the mixture starting getting thicker and gaining a bit of volume.  Eat immediately (it will be somewhat soft), or place in an airtight container in the freezer.  Makes approximately 6 to 8 servings.",

Make sure your bowl does not touch the simmering water. The more you stir the shinier your cookies will be.- When the chocolate and shortening has melted, remove the bowl from the heat; stir to assure it's completely mixed. Set aside to cool a few minutes.- Meanwhile, in another bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, vanilla paste, and espresso. Set aside.- In another bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. Set aside.- Whisk the melted chocolate into the sugar/egg mixture.- Add the flour mixture, whisk. Only whisk until blended, over-mixing can affect the texture of the pies.- Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper, no need to grease the paper.- Drop a heaping tablespoon of batter (keeping the shapes as round as possible) onto the baking sheets. You are aiming for rounds that are about 2 inches in diameter. Take care to leave some room (about 2 inches) between each one to allow for spreading that will occur as they bake.- Bake for 6 to 8 minutes.- Leave in the oven an additional minute if they seem under baked. The cookie will have a brownie like crackling surface, and will feel soft, when ready.- Allow them to cool for about 10 minutes before gently lifting them off the baking sheet and onto a flat surface for piping the filling.- For the Filling:- Combine 1 1/4 cups sugar and the water in a small saucepan.- Heat over medium heat with a candy thermometer attached to the inside of the saucepan, and stir to dissolve. - When the mixture reaches 220 degrees F it is ready for the stand mixer.- Meanwhile, in a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs on medium speed until it begins to look very foamy(about 3 minutes).- Avoiding the whisk, gradually add the remaining 2 tablespoons PLUS 1 teaspoon sugar. - Increase the speed to high and whip until soft white peaks are formed.- At this point check to see if your sugar has cooled. If it has cooled, turn heat back on to high until it comes back up to 220 degrees F just before adding to stand mixer.- When egg whites are at a soft peak stage resembling marshmallow fluff,slowly add the hot sugaralong the edge of the mixer avoiding the whisk.- Continue to whisk on high until the bowl has cooled, about 5 minutes.- Add peppermint extract, whisk another 30 seconds.- Refrigerate for 5 minutes before transferring to a piping bag with a plain tip attached or a large ziploc bag with one corner cut a 1/4 inch.- For Garnish:- Place candy canes between layers of wax paper, then sandwich between a dish towel.- Using a meat tenderizer, or the back of a dry measuring cup, pound the candy cane until broken up into very small pieces.- Make sure the candy cane is between wax paper first, otherwise, the candy cane will stick to the dish towel.- Assemble:- Turn the brookie cookies upside down, pipe about 2 tablespoons of filling onto half of the cookies.- Cover each filled cookie with a dry cookie, press down just enough so that filling adheres to the cookie.- Sprinkle crushed candy cane around the brookie pie edges.- Serve chilled or at room temperature.",

Add the zest of the limes. Slice the vanilla pod in half and carefully scrape out the vanilla seeds and add these to your milk mixture.- Simmer the milk slowly for fifteen minutes to let the flavours infuse.- Once the caramel is ready, pour into a cake pan and swirl it around to evenly coat the bottom of the pan. Set aside.- In a bowl, crack the eggs and beat together. Slowly pour a little of the warm milk , vanilla and lime mixture into the eggs. This will temper the eggs and prevent them from scrambling from the heat. Once the temperature of the eggs has been raised by the warm milk, pour in the rest of the milk. Pour all of the mixture into the cake pan over the caramel.- Cook the cake pan in a water bath by placing the pan inside a larger pan which is filled half way with water. Place in the oven and cook for 45 minutes to an hour.- Once ready, allow to cool and place inside a fridge overnight. The flan is then ready to be flipped over gently and served.",

        "instructions": "- Cut the chicken thighs into one inch sized pieces.- Add about 2 teaspoons of salt and 2 teaspoons of pepper. Or do what I always do for dishes that call for salt and pepper. I use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper. Give it a good sprinkle, about 1 tablespoon of it. Set aside to marinate for a couple of hours.- Slice the top of the tomatoes off.- Using a small spoon, scoop out the soft insides of the tomatoes. This reduces the moisture in the dish and prevents sogginess.- Chop the tomatoes up into small bits.- Chop the onions into small bits.- Place the onions and tomatoes in a large bowl.- Chop up a bunch of cilantro. Use as much or as little as you like.- Add the cilantro to the onions-tomatoes mixture. Toss together and set aside.- Cut a slit round an avocado, against its seed.- Holding each side of the cut avocado, twist the avocado open to reveal the seed.- Remove the seed and scoop out the flesh. Place the avocado flesh in a large bowl and mash it up evenly till it becomes creamy.- Add the tomatoes mixture to the avocados.- Combine well.- Squeeze in juice from one lemon.- Add a generous portion of salt to taste. About 1 to 2 teaspoons.- At this point, youll have guacamole. If you like, dish it up in a serving bowl and serve it with chips.- Now cook the chicken. Heat a pan with a few tablespoons of cooking oil till its very hot. It has to be very hot or the chicken wont brown.- Add the chicken to the pan. Be careful! Itll sizzle and splatter.- Turn the pieces over to brown the other side after a few minutes.- When the chicken are browned, remove them from the pan and set aside at a warm place.- Using a clean, dry pan, toast the tortillas one at a time on each side.- They are ready to be used when they are soft and warm.- Add a serving of the guacamole mixture.- Add a serving of the chicken.- Quickly wrap the burrito up. If it cools, the tortilla will crack and it would be impossible to roll it up.- Roll over once. Fold in the sides, and roll over again till its fully wrapped.- Serve immediately or wrap in aluminum foil and keep them in the oven till ready to eat.",

Marinate in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  Coat a large nonstick pan or a grill pan with olive oil spray, add olive oil and heat.  Add chicken, cover, and saut over medium heat until browned on both sides and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes total.  Remove the chicken from the pan- To Make Honey Lime Glaze: In a small bowl, mix together  cup lime juice, 2 tablespoons honey and Tabasco.  Add the honey lime glaze to the same pan.  Cook for about 30 seconds until melted.  Return cooked chicken to pan, flipping the chicken once to coat with the glaze.- Remove from pan and plate each piece.  Spoon watermelon salsa on top of each piece of chicken and serve with more salsa on the side.- Serve with our recipe for Simple Garlic Toast, if desired.  Recipe follows.- Recipe for Simple Garlic Toast- Start with 4 slices sourdough wheat bread. We bought ours at Trader Joes but most markets sell sourdough wheat bread or use regular sourdough slices.  Cut each slice in half and toast all of them.  Spread each half with 1 teaspoon reduced-fat butter or Smart Balance Light.  Sprinkle each with a little garlic powder.

        "instructions": "- Note: You can use a standing mixer with a dough hook to mix the dough, but we made our bread the old-fashioned way, kneading it with our hands.- Combine the yeast with warm water (this is referred to as proofing the yeast) in a small bowl along with the sugar. Gently stir the mixture to dissolve everything. Allow the yeast to stand for about 3 minutes until it gets a bit foamy.- Add the flour to a large bowl and make a well in the center of it.- In a small bowl, dissolve the salt in a few tablespoons of water, and add it to the flour along with the yeast mixture. Next add the olive oil to the mixture.- With your hands and a spatula to scrape down the bowl, mix everything together to form the dough. Punch down and knead the dough, turning it as you go, for at least 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth, soft and pliable. Add a bit of flour to the dough as needed. Form the dough into a round ball.- Add some olive oil to your hands and smooth it over the dough ball to coat it and leave it in the bowl. Cover the bowl with a thick towel and place the bowl in a warm spot to let the dough rise to double its size (about 45 minutes to an hour).- Coat a baking sheet (with sides) with olive oil and sprinkle a few tablespoons of cornmeal over the entire pan. Set aside.- Once the dough has risen, place it on a floured surface and punch it down 3-4 times. Allow it to stand for a few minutes while you get your toppings ready.- Moving back to the dough, roll and stretch it out into an oblong shape that is about 1/2 an inch thick. Place the dough on the oiled baking sheet, cover it with plastic wrap and let it stand for about 15 minutes.- Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. After the dough has rested and youre ready to bake it, poke small wells all around the dough using your finger. Brush the surface of the dough with olive oil.- Evenly sprinkle on the dried oregano, green onion, tomato and garlic. Sprinkle with coarse salt, then grated Parmesan cheese.- Bake on the bottom rack for 20 minutes, checking it as it gets close to the end of the baking time.",

After about 15 minutes, dice and add to the stew.\nRemove the skins from the tomato. If you have a soft skin peeler, you can use it to remove the skins. Otherwise, you can blanch the tomatoes in boiling water, scoring the tops first, and then removing the skins.\nCook the lentils in boiling water for 8 minutes, drain and run under cool water.\nCooking Instructions\nIn a large stock pot, heat olive oil on a medium heat. Saute the garlic for just a minute and add the onions. Season with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt and cook for about 10 minutes. Begin adding the other vegetables gradually, starting with the peppers, carrots and squash. When all the vegetables are in the stew, add the thyme, cumin, salt and oregano. Let the vegetables simmer until tender as a stock begins to form. Mix in the lentils and kidney beans. Simmer for as long as you have, up to an hour and a half.",

Pour in the hot stock, let it come to a boil and turn down the heat.- Let it simmer for 20 minutes until the kale is tender. Squeeze in  the juice of half a lemon. Check the seasoning and adjust to taste. You might want more lemon or salt  it all depends on what you have used for the stock.- Working in batches or in the pan itself if you have a stick blender, blitz until you have the texture you like. I like mine to still have a few chickpeas and pieces of kale through it so I set aside a couple of ladlefuls and used a stick blender to blitz the rest.- Serve hot, floating a couple of slices of lemon on top of each serving and pass round the parmesan cheese for everyone to help themselves.

        "instructions": "- 1. Preheat the oven to 425F. Cover a baking sheet with a piece of parchment paper.- 2. Make the biscuits: sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together into a large bowl. Using two knives or a pastry blender, cut in the butter until the texture rangers from cornmeal to the size of small peas. (These two steps can be done quickly in a food processor.) Using a fork, gradually mix in the yogurt, then the milk, until the dough is quite soft and somewhat sticky. Work quickly without overworking the dough. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it briefly, just long enough to get it to hold together. Roll it out so it is about 1 1/4 inches thick, and cut it into 2 i- 3. While the biscuits are baking, prepare the sausages: place all the sausage ingredients in a large bowl and mix thoroughly, using your fingers.- To test the seasoning, fry a tiny patty and taste; adjust if necessary.- 4. Place the patties in a large heavy or nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, and cook until they are crisp and brown on the outside and cooked through inside, about 8 minutes per side. Transfer the sausage patties to a warmed platter and keep warm.- 5. Make the gravy: Add enough of the butter to the skillet so the bottom is covered with 1/8 inch of fat. Stir, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and add the flour slowly, stirring until it has absorbed the butter. Cook, stirring constantly, until it turns golden brown, at least 2 minutes. Then slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly, and cook until the gravy thickens to the consistency of very heavy cream.<- 6. To serve, split two biscuits in half. Place the bottom halves on a warm plate, top them with sausage patties, and pour a generous amount of gravy over the sausage. Mince the fresh sage and sprinkle some over the sausage and gravy. Set the biscuit tops at an angle, partially covering the sausages and serve immediately.- 4 servings (with extra biscuits).",

Using a spoon, scrape out the dark gills from the underside of the mushroom caps.- Lightly brush the portabellas and the onions on both sides with canola oil, and sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.- Arrange the mushrooms, onion, and poblano on the hot grill, and cook for 5-6 minutes per side or until the mushrooms are softened and the onion is lightly charred. Remove from heat and transfer to a cutting board.- Remove the stem and seeds from the poblano, and discard. Cut the poblano and the portabellas into thin strips, and roughly chop the onion. Transfer to a mixing bowl and toss with lime juice and chipotle powder until well coated.- To assemble, arrange 2 tortillas per plate, and divide the mushroom filling evenly between them.  Serve with pico de gallo and bowls of the different toppings so that everyone can garnish their tacos as they please.",

I also grate my cheese and butter my two 8oz ramekins.\nI get 2 tbs butter melted in my large saucepan, and add my onions.  I sweat these out just until softened.\nI then add about 2 tbs of flour, which I mix well with the butter and onions to form a roux.  I cook this for a few moments, until fully incorporated and just turning a wee bit tan.\nI then add my heavy cream, and bring this to a simmer.  See how its thickening up?  NIIIIICE.\nIn goes most of my shredded cheese (I save some for garnish, and for Clayton to pick at), which I stir in well.  I then lower the heat, and let this simmer until thick.  I salt and pepper it to, until it tastes just right.\nIve been cooking my linguine on the back burner, and at just slightly undercooked, its ready to add to the sauce.  I reserve my pasta water, too, so that  if this gets too thick  I can add a little starchy wetness to the pan until the sauce is the right consistency.\nThe last ingredient to add to the pan is my abundance of sliced scallions (reserving some for garnish, too).  I toss this in, remove from the heat, and stir well before\nSwirling my pasta into my waiting ramekins, using tongs to make a nice nest for\nThe addition of a single, cracked (but not the yolk!), farm fresh egg for the center.  This goes in my 350 degree oven, on middle shelf, for 10 minutes to bake  just until the whites are set, but the yolk is still runny.\nOh, I also split a nice small loaf of french bread down the middle, spread it with hot melted butter, and top it with shredded robusto cheese.  I put this in the oven, too, on the top shelf, and let the cheese melt and toast while my eggs are setting.\nScrumdillyicious!\nRight before service, I sprinkle some black truffle oil (Thanks, Tom!) and some black pepper salt over the dish, just to add that umame savor that separates this meal from any ol linguine alfredo.  Served with my toasted cheese bread for sopping, I pierce the quivering sun in the middle of my creamy pasta tresses, and I dive into this hot, simple, elegant, perfect little meal.  30 minutes + very few ingredients = utter weeknight dining perfection!",

Whisk together greek yogurt, dijon mustard, and garlic powder together until well mixed. Add in salt and pepper, to taste.- Next, stir in dried cranberries or raisins and cashews. If you're worried about the cashews getting too soft, you could add them right before serving!- After the chicken is done boiling, I like to let it rest for about 5 minutes.

Next, start adding your flour a half cup at a time until its all added.Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll in the powder sugar, giving them a light coating. Place 2 apart on a room-temp baking sheet (let your sheet cool in between batches if you are reusing the same one).Bake in the oven 9-10 minutes, they wont brown too much, so watch them closely.

        "instructions": "Leave butter and cream cheese in a warm place for a couple of hours to soften. They have to be soft and cannot be used straight out of the fridge.\nPre-heat oven to 180 deg Celsius.\nPlace soft butter in a large mixing bowl. Add a block of cream cheese. Use block cream cheese, not cream cheese in a tub. Set the beater to a medium speed and beat the butter and cream cheese till its combined and light and fluffy.\nAdd 2 large egg yolks, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/2 cup of caster sugar, a pinch of salt and 2.5 cups of plain flour. Mix all the ingredients together in the mixer on medium speed. The dough should come together.\nWhile the dough is being mixed, chop 1/2 cup of walnuts into fine pieces. Set aside.\nWhen the dough is ready to be used, scatter some flour on the table or counter top. Knead the dough and gently form into a large block. Add more flour if dough is too sticky.\nThe dough should be a nice elastic block. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Set 3 pieces of dough aside. Cover with a slightly damp cloth to prevent them from drying out. Roll the 4th piece of dough into a nice ball.\nUsing a floured rolling pin, roll out that ball of dough into a flat circle. The dough should be thin, about 2 to 3mm thick. Cut the rolled dough into 8 pieces.\nPrepare some fruit preserves. I used a good jar of orange marmalade with pieces of orange rind in it. If the preserves is thick and difficult to spread, whisk it with a fork for a minute first.\nPlace one teaspoon of preserves on the long end of each triangular piece of dough. Lightly spread it towards the other end, keeping most of the preserves on the long end. Scatter some chopped walnuts on the preserves at the long end.\nTo roll the rugelach, tuck in the sides of the triangle slightly to hold the preserves and nuts in. Roll towards the 3rd corner of the triangle.\nRepeat for all the blocks of dough till the rugelachs are prepared.\nPlace all the prepared rugelachs on a sheet of baking paper on a baking tray.\nAdd 1/4 cup of caster sugar and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to a small bowl. Mix well to combine.\nMelt 50g of butter. Gently brush each rugelach with melted butter.\nSprinkle lots of the cinnamon-sugar mixture on to each rugelach. You can also roll the rugelachs in the mixture.\nPlace the rugelachs in a pre-heated oven and bake at 180 deg Celsius for about 35 minutes or till they are a dark golden brown.\nLeave the rugelachs to cool before storing them.",

        "instructions": "First off, mix the flours together and whisk so they are combined well.\nThis recipe requires you to make a sponge. For this you take 1/2 cup of flour and place in a large bowl with the half cup warm water and the yeast. Cover the bowl with plastic and let stand anywhere from 2-8 hours. This is to allow it to ferment, I personally couldn't wait the whole time, I think I made it a minute past the 2 hour mark.\nStir in the 1 cup of water a little at a time. Add in the salt and just enough of the flour to make the dough pull away from the sides of the bowl.\nTurn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead enough flour to make a soft dough. It should be smooth and elastic. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat the dough ball lightly, and cover. Place in a warm place where a draft cannot get to it and allow to rise about 1 hour.\nPrep a large baking pan (pizza pan works well) by either taking an oiled napkin and running it around the pan or line with parchment paper.\nPunch the dough down and allow to rest 10 minutes.\nOil your hands and place dough in the pan. Brush the top of the dough with oil then, using your fingers, make deep dimples in the dough, about 1/2 inch. Cover with plastic again and let rest in a warm place for 30 minutes.\nPreheat the oven to 400F(200C).\nTake the olives, feta and basil and spread on top of the foccacia. Sprinkle salt on top and place in oven. Bake 18 - 20 minutes  or until golden. Check about half way through and deflate any large bubbles with the poke of a knife.\nWhen done cooking, place on a rack to cool for about 15 - 20 minutes.\nThis bread is very versatile. You can make it into small mini loaves (as in the original recipe) or in a big one like I did. You can also top it with a number of different ingredients, just let your craving drive you :D!",

If the bottom half looks just about cooked, roughly 3 minutes, flip over, and place cheese on top.- Add red onions and buns (cut side down).- Close lid.  After another 3 or so minutes, remove everything from grill.  The cheese wont be completely melted, because of the thickness, but its okay, thats the point ;-)  The cheese will stay extra sharp if the inside isnt melted.  On the red onions, youre looking for good char marks on one side, but the onion still a bit crunchy.  For the buns, youre looking to get the bottoms nice and charred, but not so much as to make the bread tough.- To assemble the burger:  Place a handful of arugula leaves on the bottom slice of the bun.- Place burger with cheese slice on top.- Add the grilled red onions.- Slather the aioli liberally on the top half of the bun.",
